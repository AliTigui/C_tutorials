# Basic **C** tutorial

This will be simple C tutorial also ot can be used as getting started with c

it will be devided into serval tutorials each one cover simple topics 

## Tutorial 1

In this tutorial we will see C data types we will see:
### Data types 
* ``char`` it represent single character, it cost 1 byte in memory and use **Ascii** encoding 
* ``int`` it represent Integer using it in operations will generate interger
  for exemple if we devide 4/3 we get1
* ``float`` it used to represent floated point number like 3.14 
* ``long`` it same as int but it store more data that mean we can represent bogger number
* ``double`` floating point number with double precision it represents floating number with more precision and use more memory 
* array exemple ``int a[4];`` ,``int arr[]={4,5,7}`` or char ``a[]="hello";``.Array used to store multiple value of same type in one variable there is two type of arrays , fixed size like those two or dynamic size array we will see it later when we see pointer. we access element of array using indexing first element is index 0 ``arr[0]``
### Input and Output 
* how to work with functions
* pointers
* dynamic array
* struct
